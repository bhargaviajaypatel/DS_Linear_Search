# DS_Linear_Search
Linear Search is a very simple search algorithm.
In this type of search, a sequencial search is made over all items one by one. 
Every item is checked and if a a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection. 
The time complexity of the linear search is O(n) because each element in an array is compared only once.
